                      [-d|--repo-dir <repo_path>]  [-h|--help]  [-v|--verbose]
                      [<revision>]

## Description

The purpose of `git-rocket-filter` is similar to the command [`git-filter-branch`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) while providing the following unique features:

- Fast rewriting of commits and trees (by an order of `x10` to `x100`).
- Built-in support for both **white-listing** with `--keep` (keeps files or directories) and **black-listing** with `--remove` options.
- Use of `.gitignore` like pattern for tree-filtering 
- Fast and easy C# Scripting for both commit filtering and tree filtering
- Support for scripting in tree-filtering per file/directory pattern
- Automatically prune empty/unchanged commit, including merge commits

Tested on Windows and Linux (with Mono installed).


> ** Warning **
> Usage of this command has the same warning than git-filter-branch: *"The rewritten history will have different object names for all the objects and will not converge with the original branch. You will not be able to easily push and distribute the rewritten branch on top of the original branch. Please do not use this command if you do not know the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single commit would suffice to fix your problem."* (from [git-filter-branch](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) documentation)

## Download

You can get the latest stable binaries from the [Release](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter/releases) page.

#### Requirements On Linux

- You need to have installed Mono: `sudo apt-get install mono-complete` 
- Currently the command must be run from the folder it is unzipped as it cannot found the native dlls. Use the `--repo-dir` to specify on which repo directory to work.


## Examples

**Change commit messages:**

    git-rocket-filter --branch TestBranch 
                      --commit-filter 'commit.Message += "Added by git-rocket-filter";'

Rewrite all commits by adding the message "Added by git-rocket-filter" and store the results in the new branch `TestBranch`

**Change commit author name and email:**

    git-rocket-filter --branch TestBranch --commit-filter '
        if (commit.AuthorName.Contains("Jim")) {   
            commit.AuthorName = "Paul"; 
            commit.AuthorEmail = "paul@company.com"; 
        }
    '

Rewrite commits authored by Jim and change the author name and email to Paul, storing the results in the new branch `TestBranch`

**Keep a directory while remove some specific files**:

    git-rocket-filter --branch TestBranch --keep MyDirectory --delete '*.txt'

Keeps only the directory `MyDirectory` except all `*.txt` files and store the results of the rewrite to the new branch `TestBranch` 

**Removes files bigger than 1Mo**:

    git-rocket-filter --branch TestBranch 
                      --delete '* => entry.Discard = entry.Size > 1024*1024;''

Removes all files bigger than 1Mo and store results to the new branch `TestBranch` 

> **Note For Windows Users**
> The command lines above are valid for a bash shell on an Unix machine. On Windows, depending if you are running a command in a DOS/batch or a msysgit bash, some escape characters may be required in the command line to pass correctly the options (This is especially important if you are passing a C# script code in the command line):
> - In a **DOS/Batch**: you can use the double quote `"` to group pattern/command. For example, you can write the command above `git-rocket-filter --branch TestBranch --delete "* => entry.Discard = entry.Size > 1024*1024;"'. Note that DOS/Batch use [special escape characters](http://www.robvanderwoude.com/escapechars.php) that you should be aware of.
> - In a **Git bash** commonly shipped with msysgit you should be careful about the way [mingw is escaping characters](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Posix_path_conversion) on Windows. Most notably, if you use a pattern like `--keep /MyDirectory` mingw will expand it to `--keep  C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/MyDirectory` which can lead to unexpected errors!
>
> A safe way to use the command on Windows is to provide command/patterns from script file instead using `--commit-filter-script` or `--keep-script` or `--remove--script`


## Options

#### `-b | --branch <branchName>`


This option is **required**. Unlike git-filter-branch, git-rocket-filter doesn't modify your current branch. Instead, you need to pass a branch name where it will store the results of the filtering.

Note that if the branch already exists, you can force to write to it by using the option `--force`   

___
#### `-c | --commit-filter <command>`

Runs the &lt;command&gt; as a C# script on each commit. The command has access to the following variable:

- `repo`: The `LibGit2Sharp.Repository` object that allows to fully interact with the git repository.
- `commit`: The [`SimpleCommit`](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter/blob/master/src/SimpleCommit.cs) object that provides the following properties:


Property               |Access| Description
---------              |------| -----------
commit.Id              |r     | Commit id
commit.Sha             |r     | Commit id as a string
commit.AuthorName      |rw    | Author's name 
commit.AuthorEmail     |rw    | Author's email 
commit.AuthorDate      |rw    | Author's commit date
commit.CommitterName   |rw    | Committer's name 
commit.CommitterEmail  |rw    | Committer's email 
commit.CommitterDate   |rw    | Committer's commit date
commit.Message         |rw    | The commit message
commit.Tree            |rw    | The `LibGit2Sharp.Tree` object
commit.Parents         |r     | A collection of the parent commit `SimpleCommit`
commit.Tag             |rw    | A property to store a user object
commit.Discard         |rw    | A boolean that indicates if we want to keep the commit or discard it. Default is **false**

To **discard a commit**, a command can simply set `if (<condition>) { commit.Discard = true; }` or simply `commit.Discard = <condition>;` to set it based on the result of conditions...etc.

This option is mostly used for **commit-filtering** (that can be used together with tree-filtering options like `--keep`, `--remove`...) but as you have access to to the commit.Tree, you can perform also special tree-filtering accessing directly the tree. For simpler cases where you are just looking for keeping/removing files, the simpler options `--keep`/`--remote` are much more suitable and efficient. 
___
#### `--commit-filter-script <script_file>`

Similar to `--commit-filter`, but it reads the script from the given &lt;script_file&gt; 
___
#### `--keep <pattern [=> command | {% multiline command %}]>`  

Keeps the specified file/directory based on a `<pattern and command>` `<pattern> [<command>]` where 
- `<pattern>` is `.gitignore` file pattern 
- `<command>` is an optional script to evaluate on each entry: an optional script to evaluate on each entry.
    - for a one line script use the association `=>` like `=> entry.Discard = entry.Size > 10000;`
    - for a multiline script use the script enclosed by `{%` and `%}` 
    
```
         {% 
            entry.Discard = entry.Size > 10000;
         %}
```

Multiple `--keep` options are accepted.

When passing a script to be evaluated on each matching entry, the following object and properties are accessible:


- `repo`: The `LibGit2Sharp.Repository` object that allows to fully interact with the git repository.
- `commit`: The [`commit`](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter/blob/master/src/SimpleCommit.cs) object as described in the commit filter above.
- `entry`: The file [`entry`](https://github.com/xoofx/GitRocketFilter/blob/master/src/SimpleEntry.cs) object that provides the following properties:

Property               |Access| Description
---------              |------| -----------
entry.Id               |r     | Git Object id of the blog (or link if --include-links is specified)
entry.Sha              |r     | Git Object id as a string
entry.Name             |r     | Name of the entry (file name, directory name, git-link name) 
entry.Path             |r     | Full path of the entry (e.g `/my/full/path/entry`)
entry.Size             |r     | If the entry is a blob, size in bytes of the blob
entry.IsBlob           |r     | A boolean indicating if the entry is a git blob
entry.IsBinary         |r     | A boolean indicating if the entry is a binary blob 
entry.IsLink           |r     | A boolean indicating if the entry is a link commit id to a submodule  
entry.Tag             |rw    | A property to store a user object
entry.Discard         |rw    | A boolean that indicates if we want to keep the entry or discard it. Default is **false** for `--keep` matching and **true** for `--remove` matching.

The options `--keep`, `--remove`, `--keep-script`, `--remove-script` are **tree-filtering** operations because you can effectively rewrite the tree (directory/files) associated to a commit.

As the commit object is also accessible in the script, it is still possible to discard a commit from a tree-filtering operation (For example, a tree-filtering could decide to discard a commit based on the content of some files, an author modifying a certain file...etc.).


Example:
- `--keep MyDirectory`: Keeps a directory named `MyDirectory` 
- `--keep '/My/Sub/**/MyFolder'`: Keeps all folders `MyFolder`recursively from the folder `/My/Sub`
- `--keep '* => entry.Discard = entry.Size > 10000;'`: Keeps only files that are less than 10,000 bytes
___
#### `--keep-script <script_file>`

Similar to `--keep`, but it reads the patterns and commands from a script &lt;script_file&gt;

A typical script file could be:

```
# This is a pattern file
# It is using the same syntax as .gitignore (with additional syntax to attach a script
# per pattern)
# Keeps all files
*
# Except
!file_to_exclude[12].txt
```

Using scripts in the file is also straightfoward (no need to care about escape characters unlike the command line):

**Single Line scripts**

```
# Keep all files that are smaller than 1024x1024 bytes. Note the one-line script using 
# the separator `=>` 

*  => entry.Discard = entry.Size > 1024*1024;

# Except files that are stored in this specific location
/my/files/** => entry.Discard = false;  
```

**Multi Line scripts**

```
# Multiline script: Keep files that have a specific commit author and file size:

/some/specific/files/**/*.ext    {%

    if (commit.AuthorName.Contains("ThisGuy") && entry.Size > 1024*1024)
    {
        entry.Discard = true;
    }
%} 
```

You can use multiple `--keep` and `--keep-script` options from the same command line.
___
#### `--remove <pattern [=> command | {% multiline command %}]>`  

Removes the specified file/directory based on a `<pattern and command>` `<pattern> [<command>]`. Similar to the way `--keep` is working but by deleting files instead.

The same remarks applies than `--keep` applies to this option

Note when using script that the `entry.Discard` is by default set to **true** for each entry visited. You can reverse the behavior by setting **false** on a particular entry.
___
#### `--remove-script <script_file>`

Similar to `--remove`, it reads the patterns and commands from a script &lt;script_file&gt; and contains a .git-ignore list of pattern to remove.

See `--keep-script` for a description about these pattern files.

You can use multiple `--remove` and `--remove-script` options from the same command line.
___
#### `[<revision>]`

By default, git-rocket-filter is working from the first commit to the HEAD on the current branch.

This is equivalent to give the revision: `HEAD` 

Some example of revision format:
- `HEAD` is a reference to the HEAD commit.
- `commitId`: filters until the commitId
- `fromCommitId..toCommitId` filter fromCommitId (non inclusive) to toCommitId (inclusive)
- `HEAD~4..HEAD` filter the last 4 commits accessible from HEAD (going through all merge branches if any)
___
#### `[--detach]`

Use with commit filtering. By default, the commit filtering keeps the original parents of the first commits. Using the `--detach` option allows to completely remove the parents of the first commit. 

This can be useful if you want to extract a tree 
___
#### `[--include-links]`

By default, in a tree-filtering (`--keep`, `--remove`...), git-rocket-filter doesn't include links to git submodule. You can include links that specifying this option. Note that while accessing the entry in the script you must check whether the entry is a blob with `entry.IsBlob` or a link `entry.IsLink` as some properties are not valid depending on the type (like `entry.Size` only valid for blob).
___
#### `[-d|--repo-dir <repo_path>]`  

By default, git-rocket-filter is expecting to be ran under a git repository. You can specify an alternative directory `<repo_path>` to perform a filtering operations. 
___
#### `[-h|--help]`  

Prints some helps about command in the console.
___
#### `[-v|--verbose]` 

Prints some diagnostic messages about the patterns found and the final generated C# code. 
  
## Implementation details

git-rocket-filter is mostly a combined wrapper around [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) and [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).

In order to increase the performance of rewriting commits, git-rocket-filter is built upon:
- .NET Parallel tasks and threads to dispatch the work on multiple cores. The dispatch is done per tree visited and if there is a need to to perform gitignore pattern matching.
- Efficiently caching .gitignore pattern entries from LibGit2Sharp so that we avoid to callback libgit2 to perform pattern matching (which is cpu consuming in libgit2)
